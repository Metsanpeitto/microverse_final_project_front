# Microverse final project frontend

![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)


 In this task, we will be working with the real live data from the 
Microverse_final_project API. 


Our task is to build a web application for a boat renting company. 

The application requires authentication by the user. 
 No logged in users will have access only to the main page and the
account one.
 If the user sings up he can access the reservation new and index
pages as well.
 And if the user logs in as administrator, he will have access as 
well to the item new and delete 
options.

 In order to login as administrator just press sign in button and
the app will use the deault values, that has administrator role.
